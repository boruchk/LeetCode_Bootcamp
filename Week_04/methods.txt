BFS Graph traversal
list containing vistited nodes
queue containing neighboring nodes of current node
  dequeu node
  check neighboring nodes
  add them to the queue if they are not vistited
  add curr node to vistited

DFS Graph traversal
list containing vistited nodes
stack containing neighboring nodes of current node
  get last added element
  check neighboring nodes
  add them to the stack if they are not vistited
  add curr node to vistited
can implement recursively

Khan's algo for
Topological sort
n-degree = edges coming into it
  start with node that has n-degree == 0
  visit that node (add to visted list)
  all connected nodes, decrement n-degree of neighboring nodes by one
  find next node that has n-degree == 0
  visit that node (add to visted list)
  continue above
visted list = top sorted
